# TRYNDRAW
TRYNDRAW is a social-lite drawing platform. Users are given randomly generated prompts that depict funny senarios. Then they are tasked to "try and draw" these prompts relying on their imagination and humor. Once they are done, the drawing is uploaded onto the platform for their friends and the world to see!
